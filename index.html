                        <p>Hi! My name is Shain Dholakiya and I am 19 years old. I was born in Rome, GA and went to
                            Berry College
                            Elementary School. My parents are from India and know very little English which is why I am
                            fluent in Gujarati
                            and Hindi.
                            My brother is 23 years old and works as an IOS Developer in Chicago. He went to college for
                            two years and dropped
                            out. He did three coding bootcamps, one of which was called Mobile Makers, and got a job
                            through one of his
                            mentors.
                            He got into coding when he was about 18 buying and selling things like phones, laptops, and
                            game consoles on
                            Amazon. He wanted to make his own website, but didn't want to pay anyone to do it, so he
                            learned how on his own.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>I am a sophmore at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently
                            enrolled in the
                            Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp and excited to see where it takes me. My
                            hobbies include working out
                            and playing flag football.</p>
